  <h2> Hills Have Eyes</h2>
<img src="hollywood.jpg" align=center>

<p>Originally, the Hollywood sign represents is the idea of idealistic and nearly unattainable but

desired fame and recognition. Growing up, I had always had a particular connection to Hollywood. I was

always mesmerized by the idea of “fame,” and have gone through many “fan girl” stages in my life. It is

fascinating to me just how much power and influence Hollywood has over the average person. I

remember how much Hollywood films and musicians influenced me as a pre-teen and teen, and how it

continues to influence me today. To most people, Hollywood represents the lifestyles of the rich and

famous, and the people who can get whatever they desire just because of who they are. Hollywood is

popular culture and heavily influences what is a trend at any given time to a large population of people.

It is such a huge influence on society that it has the power to turn anyone from an average person into a

superstar overnight.

I manipulated the image of the Hollywood logo in several different ways for my project. The first

two images I tried to imagine Hollywood and fame from a celebrity perspective. I read a very interesting

study about the psychology of the celebrity, and learned some very interesting things about what it’s

like. Celebrities often describe the anxiety of constantly living under public scrutiny because they are

always in the public eye. Because of this, I created an overlay mask of a collage of eyes over the

Hollywood sign, so it would appear as though the eyes are staring out of the sign. The subject is the

shadow of a celebrity, who aside from his/her talent is just as much of an individual as all of the

paparazzi taking pictures on the sides. Nevertheless, no matter how “normal” this silhouetted celebrity

might wish to be, they know that they can never escape the “all knowing” eyes of Hollywood and fans

that are watching their every move. This image, if created more professionally and in the context of

paranoid and constantly being watched, I could see as the cover of a horror movie poster.</p>

<h3> Branded </h3>
<img src="attention.jpg" align=center>

<p>I created a “branding” of the Hollywood logo on the actresses forehead.

Another aspect of fame that was discussed in the study I read was the loneliness that celebrities are said to feel

despite never being alone. Social media is a very powerful tool in promoting celebrities in ways that

celebrities could never be promoted before recent times. The comments, likes, and millions of followers

floating around the celebrity who is otherwise on her own speak to the notion of being alone in a

crowded room. The power of social media in Hollywood makes fame much more intense and tangible.

Now fans can see into the “personal” lives of celebrities, which create a two way interaction where

celebrities can also see the negative and positive things written about them. Social media makes the

celebrities appear larger than life, inflating their sense of self and giving them extensive pressure to be

perfect, or at least live up to the perfect online image that Hollywood creates. The context of social

media’s influence on celebrity identity is something that I think would work really well for this photo.

This piece of artwork I could see at a place like the MOMA, because the content of the art is too recent

to be appreciated by “classic” art lovers.</p>

<h3> Identity </h3>
<img src="identity.jpg" align=center>

<p> This image is based on the idea that Hollywood influences the collective society’s identity. I

used three of the most googled female celebrities to create a collage of a face of what Hollywood tells

us is beautiful. The face is asymmetrical and uneven to show the unattainable nature of the perfection

that Hollywood feeds us every day. The Hollywood logo is editing in so it is as if it is engrained in the

average person’s brain. With plastic surgery and the extensive use of Photoshop in the media today,

girls of all ages feel insecure because they are unable to achieve such perfection, and little do they know

it is not real to begin with. I could see this image on a billboard promoting girls to love themselves the

way they are rather than trying to live up to the unreal societal Hollywood-imposed standards of beauty. </p>
