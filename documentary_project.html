<p> For this project I did not choose a place, but rather memories of people that are very close to one another. I thought it would be interesting to take people that are best friends and ask them the same questions in order to compare and contrast their answers. Memory does not always have to tie to a place, it can also tie to a person. Often, the memories and feelings you share with someone outweigh the places you may have shared the memories. I want the viewers to learn about shared memory through my video. It is possible for people to have a shared memory of a huge, life changing event, and is fairly normal. But for a pair of people to have similar recollections of many events, as well as recollections of different shared events is interesting. I think it is valuable for people to see how similar or different people that are close friends can be. Some of the answers my interviewees agreed on completely, while other answers were very, or slightly different from each other. I wanted my video to imitate the Buzzfeed documentary interview style, where a set of interviews can be turned into somewhat of an entertaining story, and the stories are organized by interview questions. I wanted the video to be light hearted but at the same time thoughtful. It is very interesting to see how similar a lot of the girlsâ€™ memories and answers to questions are very similar. I think that people do not realize how much memory affects friendships. My viewing audience would probably be young adults. Basically the audience that watches Buzzfeed would be the one I would want for this video.</p>
