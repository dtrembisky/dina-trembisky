<b> Sonic Memory Artist Statement</b>
<p> In this project, I am trying to convey the memories of recruitment that girls in Greek Life have. Recruitment is very different for girls than it is for boys, and is a much more structured, strict, and emotional process. There are many sensory occurrences during the process that my interviewees did not recall on, but this might be because of the sensory overload that comes from the overwhelming nature of the process. The way that the commons transforms from an everyday campus location to a place with significant meaning is something I was trying to make apparent in the podcast. 
The way I edited, I wanted to convey it like a story. I wanted to have people discussing their experiences with the process along with the “professional,” the person who comes in with all the factual information, throughout the story. I tried to incorporate sound effects into the text so it would appear as if the person was actually there, during recruitment. Unfortunately, because of the secretive nature of the process, there are very few videos and sound effects that can convey the auditory memories properly. Due to this, I had my interviewees describing some of the sounds that could not be conveyed as actions instead. I used one piece of music that started out calm and built up a little bit throughout the podcast. I wanted it to help create a sort of emotion associated with waiting and worrying, which is a lot of what recruitment is. With the countdown before doors open, I added an echo to the girls’ voice because I wanted it to help convey the nervousness that comes with waiting in line before going into each “party.” Then, when the doors open, the group of potential members is met with a bunch of screaming cheering girls, which is equally intimidating and confusing. Because of this, I thought it would be impactful to add a recording of a cheer that one of the sororities does. As I mentioned before, finding the right kinds of sound bites to make this piece more effective ended up being more difficult than I thought. Initially I thought I could record a lot of my own sounds, but ended up not having enough time to do that, so I had to get most of them (minus the interviews) off of the internet.
The inspiration behind this sonic project is definitely shows on NPR like Radio Lab and This American Life. I think it could be an interesting “inside story” on something that everyone who has been to American college knows about but most people do not have the inside perspective on how it impacts people and why it is so important to the people that are a part of it. Podcast series like Serial that incorporates interviews and other sound bites that add to the story is what I was aiming for.
The ideal audience would probably be college students. Regardless of whether or not they are interested in actually joining Greek Life, it is still interesting to gain new insight into different social circles and organizations on campus. In particular with Greek Life, there are many negative stigmas and stereotypes because of the media. Although this is not the case at UMBC, at state schools where Greek life is bigger, recruitment is very evident on campuses during the time it is occurring. This sonic memory would allow for college students to actually see what their peers are going through.
